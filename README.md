# Financial and Election Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves creating Python scripts to analyze financial records and election data. The assignment consists of two challenges: PyBank and PyPoll, each dealing with a different dataset. It aims to enhance Python scripting skills and apply them to real-world data analysis scenarios.

### PyBank

#### Description
The PyBank challenge involves analyzing financial records from a dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset contains two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The goal is to calculate key financial metrics and generate a summary report.

**Key Metrics**
- Total number of months included in the dataset.
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and the average of those changes.
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount).
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).

**Steps taken**
After reading the budget_data.csv file, I calculated and printed the financial metric, and then exported the results to a text file.

**Tools & Techniques**
- Python scripting
- CSV file handling
- Data manipulation with lists and dictionaries

**Applications**
This section of the project provides insights into the financial performance of the company over time. And helps in identifying significant financial trends and anomalies.

### PyPoll

#### Description
The PyPoll challenge involves analyzing election data from a dataset called election_data.csv. The dataset contains three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The goal is to calculate election results and generate a summary report.

**Key Metrics**
- Total number of votes cast.
- Complete list of candidates who received votes.
- Percentage of votes each candidate won.
- Total number of votes each candidate won.
- Winner of the election based on popular vote.

**Steps Taken**
After reading the election_data.csv file, I calculated and printed the election results, and exported the results to a text file. 

**Tools & Techniques**
- Python scripting
- CSV file handling
- Data manipulation with lists and dictionaries

**Applications**
This section of the project modernizes the vote-counting process for a small, rural town.Additionally,provides a clear and concise summary of election results.

### Conclusion
These Python scripts automate the analysis of financial and election data, providing valuable insights and modernizing processes that would be cumbersome in Excel. The challenges demonstrate the power and efficiency of Python for handling real-world data analysis tasks.
